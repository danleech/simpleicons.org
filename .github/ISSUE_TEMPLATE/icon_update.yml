        Is there anything else we should know about the brand? For example:
        - Are there multiple options for the logo and/or color?
        - Is the icon licensed?
        - If the brand isn't popular enough by the default criteria, how can we assess the popularity instead?
        - If you think the brand might not be accepted for other reasons, why do you think it should be considered?
